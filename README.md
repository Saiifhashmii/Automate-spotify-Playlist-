# Spotify Playlist Automation with Terraform ðŸŽµ

This project demonstrates how to automate the creation of **Spotify playlists** using **Terraform** and the **Spotify Web API**. The goal is to show how **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** can be used to interact with external services, such as Spotify, to automate the creation and management of playlists based on a user's preferences (e.g., artist-based playlists).

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Using Terraform, this project allows users to create and manage Spotify playlists with tracks fetched dynamically based on artist names. The project includes the creation of a sample playlist called "Heartbroken" with predefined tracks, and you can modify the configuration to create playlists with different names and track lists.

### Features:
- Automate the creation of Spotify playlists using **Terraform**.
- Search for tracks from a specific artist using the **Spotify Web API**.
- Easily modify playlists by changing the track list in the Terraform configuration.
- No need to manually add tracks â€” everything is automated!
